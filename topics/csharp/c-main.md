## C#(Sharp)

C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. The .NET ecosystem is composed of all the implementations of .NET, including both but not limited to .NET Core, and .NET Framework. 

C# is used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), back-end services, and desktop applications.

.NET generally refers to the family of programs and commands that let you make applications with C#.

### Data Types and Variables in C#
Languages like C# tell a computer about the type of data in its program using data types.

C# is strongly-typed, so it requires us to specify the data types that we’re using. It is also statically-typed, which means it will check that we used the correct types before the program even runs.

```c#
string stringVar = "Hello World!!";
int intVar = 100;
float floatVar = 10.2f;
char charVar = 'A';
bool boolVar = true;
```

* `int` - whole numbers, like: 1, -56, 948

* `double` - decimal numbers, like: 239.43909, -660.01

* `char` - single characters, like: “a”, “&”, “£”

* `string` - string of characters, like: “dog”, “hello world”

* `bool` - boolean values, like: true or false
