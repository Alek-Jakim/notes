## Big-O Notation

The Big-O notation measures the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.

In Big-O notation, `n` represents the number of inputs. The question asked
with Big-O is the following: “What will happen as n approaches infinity?”

When you implement an algorithm, Big-O notation is important
because it tells you how efficient the algorithm is.
