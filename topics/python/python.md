## Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

* the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;

* statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;

* no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
