## Database

A database is a set of organized data. It may take the form of a text file or a spreadsheet. In simple terms, it can be defined as a collection of items that can exist over a long period of time.

A database does not only contain the data that you need, but also what you call its metadata. This is the information that defines or describes the dataâ€™s structure within the given database.
